      "question": "1. Which of the following will have highest catalytic activity:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "100 cubes of catalyst 1mm each side.",
        "b": "100 spheres of catalyst of radius 1mm each.",
        "c": "100 hemispheres of catalyst of radius 1mm each.",
        "d": "100 cones of catalyst of radius and height 1 mm each."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "the surface area of each cube will be 6mm<sup>2</sup>",
        "b": "the surface area of each sphere will be 12.56 mm<sup>2</sup>. Higher the surface area the more is the catalytic activity.",
        "c": "the surface area of each hemisphere will be 6.28 mm<sup>2</sup>",
        "d": "surface area of each cone will be 7.58 mm<sup>2</sup>"

      "question": "2. How do catalysts work?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Lowers activation energy",
        "b": "Increases activation energy",
        "c": "Make more reactants",
        "d": "Mixes the reactants properly."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "catalysts bring reactants closer on their surface and hence decrease the activation energy of the reaction.",
        "b": "inhibitor increases the activation energy of the reaction.",
        "c": "catalyst do not have any effect on the concentration of reactants",
        "d": "catalysts do not mix the reactants."

      "question": "3. What does a positive catalyst do?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Slows a reaction",
        "b": "Speeds up a reaction",
        "c": "Inhibits a reaction",
        "d": "Improves other catalyst"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Negative catalysts decrease the overall rate of the chemical reaction.",
        "b": "Positive catalysts are those catalysts which increase the rate of the reaction This means that the activation energy of the reaction is lowered, and the speed of the reaction also increases.",
        "c": "inhibitors are the same as negative catalysts.",
        "d": "Promoters or co-catalyst are the substances which increase the catalytic activity of catalyst being used."

      "question": "4. Which of the following is incorrect for a catalyst?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Bio-chemical reactions are mostly catalysed by enzymes",
        "b": "Catalyst does not start a reaction",
        "c": "Catalyst changes the equilibrium constant of a reaction",
        "d": "Co-enzymes increase the activity of an enzyme"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "enzymes act as catalysts in reactions occurring in biological systems like pepsin, trypsin.",
        "b": "catalysts can start a reaction by decreasing the energy barrier.",
        "c": "catalysts affect the rate of the reaction but do not affect the rate constant.",
        "d": "co-enzymes are co-catalyst for enzymes which increase the catalytic activity of enzymes."
