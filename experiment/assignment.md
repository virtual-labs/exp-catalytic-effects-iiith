**Pre-Assignment:**

1. What property of metal particles is used in the study of their formation kinetics?  
2. Can one follow the reduction of eosin by borohydride by measuring the absorbance of gold particles and Why?  
3. Why does one need to use gold particles in the reduction of eosin by sodium borohydride?  
4. In how many ways may finely divided particles facilitate the catalysed reaction?  

**Post-Assignment:**

1. Do you observe any induction period for the commencement of eosin reduction reaction?  
2. What happens to the color of gold particles after its participation in the catalysis?  
3. What was the absorbance value of the gold seed particle solution?  
4. What was the initial absorbance value of the reaction solution used for the reduction kinetics study?  
5. How can one follow the reduction of eosin at Î»=535 nm near its maximum absorbance wavelength where gold nanoparticles also absorb light?  
6. Why does the catalysed reaction rate varies for different sized particle samples, though the same quantity of gold and all other reactants are used?
